# Business-Research-Project
This is smaller project that was done as an assignment in my business course to showcase knowledge understanding, and research of Copyright within the design industry. 
For the design choices I decided to focus on narrative arc and telling a story within design. Each section of the page from beginning to end influences the reader to continue scrolling. 
This was developed using a jQuery plugin to achieve the scrollable image sequence in the background, and a JavaScript library called scrollr.js to animate the sections in and out smoothly.
