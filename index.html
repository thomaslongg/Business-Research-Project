      <h1>Recognize this poster? Thought so…</h1>
      <p>The fact is this iconic poster that was used in the Obama campaign in 2008 was actually created by an artist by
        the name of Shepard Fairey. Now Fairey, like a lot of us didn’t curate this piece of art out of thin air, no, he
        needed a bit of inspiration. A visual reference if you will. Unfortunately for Fairey, he used the wrong bit of
        inspiration without asking for permission. </p>

      <h1>What Now?</h1>
      <p>The photo he referenced was actually owned by an Associated Press photographer. One by the name of Mannie
        Garcia. From a glance, you can see the poster and the photo bare a striking resemblance to one another. Almost
        identical. So, it was obvious, The Associated press and Shepard Fairey found each other in court over usage rights of the well-recognized image of President Obama. </p>

      <h1>…But Who Cares?</h1>
      <p>Well, content creators of all types should care. The fact of the matter is Fairey could have avoided this
        situation altogether had he simply asked for permission. The U.S. Copyright Code gives the creator of a
        photograph (or any kind of creative work, including movies, books, articles and songs) – the legal right to
        limit how other people can use the photo. </p>

      <h1>In My Opinion</h1>
      <p>Personally, I feel that Fairey was right in some sense when he stated that his poster transforms the image in
        Garcia’s picture into a brand-new work of art, because it did. However, he profited from the image, and went
        against the laws of Copyright by using Garcia’s image without official permission.
        A photograph, like any piece of creative work, becomes protected by copyright as soon as it is “fixed.” That
        means, as soon as the image is recorded in the photographer’s camera. When a photo is copyrighted, that means
        that the owner has the right to decide how other people use it. The laws speak for themselves and they’re there
        for good reason. It is part of our duty as designers and developers to be aware of them and abide.
